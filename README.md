# Branch-and-Bound

This repository contains an implementation of the **Branch-and-Bound (B&B)** algorithm to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The **Hungarian algorithm** was used as a relaxation technique, but it was not implemented from scratch in this project.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- [`instances/`](instances/) - Contains the TSP instances used for testing.
- [`src/`](src/) - Contains the Branch and Bound implementation.
